| 1/4" Mono Panel Jack | 10 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10PCS-4PIN-1-4-6-35mm-Female-Socket-Mono-Jack-for-Amplifier/201538773561?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D49129%26meid%3D45f6f9b11593449fabcf9d6d09624120%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D172778638463&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851) | £2.99 | 0 | - |
| Potentiometer | 1 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/1K-1M-ohm-Lin-Linear-Log-Logarithmic-Mono-Stereo-Pot-Potentiometer-Or-Knobs/170703080727?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D49129%26meid%3Da487b85fcc564ca58f8a86d3b736bcb6%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D122248907777&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851) | £0.99 | £1.56 | What's good about those is that you can buy potentiometers + matching knobs from this seller. Potentiometers are linear or logarythmic - same resistance, but different resistance progression, good for experimenting. Also, I have some 10KOhm potentiometers at home. Two of them in line will give the same effect. |
| Board | 5 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Strip-Board-Printed-Circuit-PCB-Vero-Prototyping-Track-Packs-of-5/261199157440?hash=item3cd0aed8c0:m:mDZYtyKIelPhIfrJ34_SRVg) | £4.86 | £1.99 | It's a pack of five boards. Looks like a lot, but you'll need more than one - you **will** make mistakes :) You don't have to get it now. I have some [breadboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard) you can practice on and when you're happy with the prototype, then you can buy those boards and permanently solder your amplifier. |
| Amplifier | 5 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/5-x-LM386-Audio-Amplifier-IC-LM386N-DIP-DIL8-1st-CLASS-POST/121681683764?hash=item1c54cb2534:g:CTEAAOSw3ydVgzU4) | £0.99 | £2.60 | I don't see a board socket listed for those in the instruction photos. Not sure what the idea is, but you don't want to be soldeting those directly on the board. I have many spare sockets like that at home, but if you want to buy your own, [here's a link](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DIL-DIP-IC-Socket-6-8-14-16-18-20-Pin-Sockets-1st-CLASS-POST-/290767443526?_trksid=p5731.m3795).
