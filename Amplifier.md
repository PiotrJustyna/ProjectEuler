| 1/4" Mono Panel Jack | 10 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10PCS-4PIN-1-4-6-35mm-Female-Socket-Mono-Jack-for-Amplifier/201538773561?_trkparms=aid%3D555018%26algo%3DPL.SIM%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D49129%26meid%3D45f6f9b11593449fabcf9d6d09624120%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D172778638463&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851) | £2.99 | 0 | - |
| Potentiometer | 1 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/1K-1M-ohm-Lin-Linear-Log-Logarithmic-Mono-Stereo-Pot-Potentiometer-Or-Knobs/170703080727?_trkparms=aid%3D222007%26algo%3DSIM.MBE%26ao%3D2%26asc%3D49129%26meid%3Da487b85fcc564ca58f8a86d3b736bcb6%26pid%3D100005%26rk%3D5%26rkt%3D6%26mehot%3Dpp%26sd%3D122248907777&_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851) | £0.99 | £1.56 | What's good about those is that you can buy potentiometers + matching knobs from this seller. Potentiometers are linear or logarythmic - same resistance, but different resistance progression, good for experimenting. Also, I have some 10KOhm potentiometers at home. Two of them in line will give the same effect. |
| Board | 5 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Strip-Board-Printed-Circuit-PCB-Vero-Prototyping-Track-Packs-of-5/261199157440?hash=item3cd0aed8c0:m:mDZYtyKIelPhIfrJ34_SRVg) | £4.86 | £1.99 | It's a pack of five boards. Looks like a lot, but you'll need more than one - you **will** make mistakes :) You don't have to get it now. I have some [breadboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadboard) you can practice on and when you're happy with the prototype, then you can buy those boards and permanently solder your amplifier. |
| Amplifier | 5 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/5-x-LM386-Audio-Amplifier-IC-LM386N-DIP-DIL8-1st-CLASS-POST/121681683764?hash=item1c54cb2534:g:CTEAAOSw3ydVgzU4) | £0.99 | £2.60 | I don't see a board socket listed for those in the instruction photos. Not sure what the idea is, but you don't want to be soldeting those directly on the board. I have many spare sockets like that at home, but if you want to buy your own, [here's a link](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DIL-DIP-IC-Socket-6-8-14-16-18-20-Pin-Sockets-1st-CLASS-POST-/290767443526?_trksid=p5731.m3795). |
| 220uF capacitor | 2 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Radial-Electrolytic-Capacitors-Various-Value-and-Voltage/111047335596?hash=item19daefdeac:m:mLlHCHD7YyD7KfTimxGfciQ) | £1.09 | £2.45 | The voltage for those is not specified in the instruction, so you'll have to double check before ordering. |
| 10uF capacitor | 2 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Radial-Electrolytic-Capacitors-Various-Value-and-Voltage/111047335596?hash=item19daefdeac:m:mLlHCHD7YyD7KfTimxGfciQ) | £0.99 | 0 | Same seller as above, probably posted in the same package. Same comment about voltage. |
| 47nF capacitor | 2 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Polyester-Film-Capacitor-250V-Rate-Values-between-3-9NF-47NF-Free-Post/122758503291?hash=item1c94fa1b7b:m:mdQ_BSH2qt5oqgmI-0fCmjg) | £0.99 | £2.45 | - |
| 1nF capacitor | 10 | [ebay](http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Ceramic-Disc-Capacitors-50V-47-values-10-1000pcs/231179599601?hash=item35d360bef1:m:mIA8vDYE-tD3WKUbDcR2xGQ) | £0.99 | £1.56 | - |
| 10KOhm resistor | almost unlimited | Piotr | 0 | 0 | I have a ton of those at home. Don't even think of buying them. |
| Battery connectors | 10 | [ebay](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/10-Pcs-Snap-9V-9-Volt-Battery-Clip-Connector-I-Type-Black-w-Cable-N5R9/282450833242?_trkparms=aid%3D555019%26algo%3DPL.BANDIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20151005190540%26meid%3D2cca270c929e4ded85b8defad520d2d0%26pid%3D100505%26rk%3D1%26rkt%3D1%26&_trksid=p2045573.c100505.m3226) | £1.12 | 0 | - |

Parcel Motel could be a very good option to reduce postage costs. Some of those sellers send for free to UK. If you don't have Parcel Motel set up, let me know.
